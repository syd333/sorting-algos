// INSERTION SORT
// builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger left half which is always sorted

// PSEUDOCODE
// start by picking the second element in the array
// now compare the second element with the one before it & swap if necessary
// continue to the next element and if it is in the incorrect order, iterate through
//      the sorted portion (left side) to place the element in correct place
// repeat until the array is sorted

function insertionSort (arr) {
